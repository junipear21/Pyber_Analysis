# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of the Anlaysis
- The purpose of this project was to help the PyBer company visualize their rideshare data using matplotlib and pandas plotting tools. In the initial work, I created line graphs, bar charts, pie charts and scatter plots to represent data visually. For the final project, my task was to reorganize the data into a new data frame, and create a line graph to display parts of the new data frame.
## Results 
- My findings, in ![Data frame of pyber summary](/Resources/pyber_summary_df.PNG), were that urban drivers were typically abundant, drove shorter routes, and had lower average fares. Rural divers, on the other hand,  were more scarce, drove longer routes, and had higher average fares. Suburban drivers were a mix of the two where they fell inbetween rural and urban metrics.
- My findings were furthur demonstrated by my graph ![Graph of PyBer Fare Summary](/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png) which shows that the sum of fares for each week were highest for urban drivers, second highest for suburban drivers, and lowest for rural drivers. This points out that although rural drivers get higher pay, there are less of them and fewer ride opportunites, leading to less fares overall. The opposite is true for urban drivers.

## Summary
-Based on the data, I would recommend one of three things to help with disparities amongst drivers. Firstly, PyBer could give part of the revenue earned from urban drivers to rural drivers. The second option is to raise the cost for rural and suburban trips so that they have the similar aggregate fares as urban drivers. The third recommendation is starting a hiring campaign in rural areas so that the numbers of drivers available increases and the avarage fare for rual rides decreases.
